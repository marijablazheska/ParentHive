        <h2 class="mt-3">Community Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the forum! This is a safe and supportive space where parents, guardians, grandparents, and soon-to-be
            parents come together to share experiences, seek advice, and support one another through the challenges of
            raising children. To maintain a welcoming and helpful environment for all users, please follow the guidelines
            below:
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-3">Zero Tolerance for Toxicity</h3>
        <p>
            We encourage open discussion and respectful critique of parenting approaches and advice. It is natural for
            people to have different opinions or parenting philosophies. When disagreeing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus your response on the idea or advice, not the person sharing it.</li>
            <li>Use respectful, solution-focused language that contributes positively to the conversation.</li>
            <li>Avoid sarcasm, name-calling, or dismissive tones.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Personal attacks, insults, hostility, bullying, or condescending behavior will not be tolerated under any
            circumstances, and we encourage users to report such misconduct.  Any user engaging in toxic behavior will
            face immediate and appropriate consequences, including temporary mute or permanent account ban, depending
            on severity.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-3">Do Not Abuse the Reporting System</h3>
        <p>
            The reporting system exists to flag harmful, abusive, or clearly inappropriate content for moderator review.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mass reporting, reporting the same post repeatedly, reporting users for personal disagreements, or intentionally
            submitting false reports is considered abuse. Users found misusing the reporting system may have reporting privileges
            revoked or face account penalties.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-3">What happens after a report is sent?</h3>
        <p>
            After a report has been submitted, it will await manual review by our moderation team. Once the report has been
            properly reviewed, we will inform you whether it has been accepted or declined.
